1-	Multi-region-storage-project
a.	Create s3 buckets in multi regions via AWS ex, Sydney and Canada
b.	Enable s3 versioning functions on both storage
c.	Create a multi-region access point to connect and access s3 multi-region storage
d.	Configure the multi-region access point, add both s3 buckets to the AP
e.	Create a replication role to replicate all objects in all region storage
f.	Select all the s3 buckets to replicate 
g.	Set the options to replicate all objects and complete the process

Now we have created an AWS multi-region storage for the users to use and upload their files. AWS will select the region near the usersâ€™ location, store their file in s3 buckets, and automatically replicate it to other regions.
